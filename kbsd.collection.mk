###
# Manage kBSD collections
#
# A collection is defined by adding its collection variable stem to the ALL_COLLECTION variable
# A payload defines
#      COLLECTION_DESC 		- a one liner describing the collection for the user
#      COLLECTION_OUT 		- a directory name _with trailing slash_ containing all the output of the collection
#								defaults to COLLECTION-root
#      COLLECTION_DEPEND 	- a list of dependencies that are to be collected
#      COLLECTION_PLDEPEND 	- a list of payload dependencies that are to be collected
#	   COLLECTION_COPY		- if defined, payload output is copied into the collection output
#	   COLLECTION_LOADERLOCAL-	anything to add to loader.conf.local
#
#
# User defined behaviour overrides
# 
# For all collections, the following targets are defined
#	  COLLECTION			- convenience target
#     collect-COLLECTION	- chained to COLLECTION
#	  ${${cl}_LOADER_CONF}  - filename of colletions loader.conf.local, chained to collect-COLLECTION
#     clean-COLLECTION 		- chain of cleanups
#     clean 				- chained to clean-COLLECTION
# For collections with COPY, the following targets are defined
#     .COLLECTION-copy.done - flag value
#     copy-COLLECTION 		- perform the copy
#     collect-COLLECTION	- chained to copy-PAYLOAD
