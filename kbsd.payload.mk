# Manage kBSD payloads
#
# A payload is defined by adding its payload variable stem to the ALL_PAYLOAD variable
# A payload defines
#      PAYLOAD_DESC 		- a one liner describing the payload for the user
#      PAYLOAD_OUT 			- a directory name _with trailing slash_ containing all the output of the payload, even if a single file
#      PAYLOAD_DEPEND 		- a list of dependencies that need to be met before the payload can be processed
#                				the last dependency is the source directory of the payload with a trailing slash
#	   PAYLOAD_PLDEPEND		- list of payload dependencies
#	   PAYLOAD_LOADERLOCAL	- lines to be appended to loader.conf.local when using this payload
#      PAYLOAD_EXCLUDE 		- files/directories to be excluded in a synchronization job
#      PAYLOAD_EXCLUDEFILE  - file with files/directories to be excluded in a synchronization job
#      PAYLOAD_INCLUDE 		- files/directories to be included in a synchronization job
#      PAYLOAD_TOOLS 		- absolute filenames for tools that are included from the template directory
#      PAYLOAD_PKG 			- package names that shall be installed
#	   PAYLOAD_PKGEXCLUDE	- paths/files to exclude from installed packages
#							  defaults to ${KBSD_PKGEXCLUDE}
#
#
# User defined behaviour overrides
#     KBSD_PKGEXCLUDE		- list of paths/files to be excluded by default in package payloads
#							  defaults to man include doc *.a
#	  REPOS_DIR				- pkg environment repos dir
#							  defaults to /etc/pkg
# 
# For all payloads, the following targets are defined
#     .PAYLOAD.done			- flag value
#     PAYLOAD				- convenience target
#     clean-PAYLOAD 		- chain of cleanups
#     clean 				- chained to clean-PAYLOAD
# For synchronization payloads, the following targets are defined
#     .PAYLOAD-sync.done 	- flag value
#     sync-PAYLOAD 			- perform the synchronization
#     PAYLOAD 				- chained to sync-PAYLOAD
#     clean-sync-PAYLOAD 	- clean the output
#     clean-PAYLOAD 		- chained to clean-sync-PAYLOAD
# For tools payloads, the following targets are defined
#     ${PL_OUT}/toolname 	- CP target for every tool (absolute pathname)
#     .PAYLOAD-tools.done	- flag the copying of all tools
#     tools-PAYLOAD 		- perform all tool copying
#     PAYLOAD 				- chained to tools-PAYLOAD
#     clean-tools-PAYLOAD 	- remove all tools from target
#     clean-PAYLOAD 		- chained to clean-tools-PAYLOAD
# For package payloads, the following targets are defined
#     .PAYLOAD-pkginst.done - flag the installation of the package in the intermediate directory (PAYLOAD_OUT.pkg)
#     .PAYLOAD-pkgsync.done - flag the copying of the package files from the intermediate directory
#     pkg-PAYLOAD 			- perform installation of packages and copying of the files
#     PAYLOAD 				- chained to pkg-PAYLOAD
#     clean-pkg-PAYLOAD 	- remove package related files
#     clean-PAYLOAD 		- chained to clean-pkg-PAYLOAD
